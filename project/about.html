Amazon has received a lot of attention lately with their HQ2 search.  Amazon is searching for another metropolitan area to build its second global headquarters facilities and operations.  They have identified several key decision drivers that include transportation capabilities, and strong business climate and community quality of life.

</p>
<p>
	Many companies from very established giants to start-ups are like Amazon in that they understand the benefits that can come from choosing the best metropolitan area.  Many companies however do not have the resources Amazon does to adequately analyze and make this decision.
</p>
<p>
The Berkeley MIDS W209 Team of Dan Wald, Todd Young, and Mike Frazzini has built this HQ Search visualization tool that is designed to help companies who are making corporate or plant location decisions.  This tool uses public airline and air-travel data to provide insights into air travel capabilities, and infer business climate and general desirability by looking at aggregated air travel origin and destination volumes and differentials.
</p>
<br>
<ul>To Use The Tool:</ul>
<br>
<li><a href="./hq_explorer/hq_explorer.html">Explore HQ City Candidates by Air Route Connectedness and Capabilities</a></li>
<br>
<li><a href="./hq_airdesireability/airdesireability.html">Find HQ City Candidates by Air Desireability</a></li>
<br>
<li><a href="./hq_citystats/citystats.html">Find HQ City Candidates by City Stats</a></li>
<br>
<p>
Additionally, as sustainability is an important consideration for Amazon, it should also be evaluated.
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sunday-review/the-biggest-carbon-sin-air-travel.html" target="_blank">Given that air travel is considered a significant source of carbon emissions</a>, we will also examine and provide visual insights into each metropolitan areasâ€™ air travel efficiency through utilization rates.
