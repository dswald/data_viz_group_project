Please search GitHub for reveal.js and install it into your project directory.
Then take the contents of this directory (the index.html file, the pics/ directory
and all the image files inside the pics/ directory) and move them to the reveal.js 
directory that gets created upon install of the reveal code. That directory was
called reveal.js-3.6.0/ in my case.
